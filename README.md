# Android-app launch checklist



This document should be a collaborative effort from the groups. 
The groups must construct and finish the app launch checklist.

Each group will have 3 topics to research and present @ 10.30.

The point of presenting these topics is to involve the students and to better understand the concept when releasing an app on the
Google store.

##1. Understand the Publishing Process

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

##4. Determine your App’s Content Rating

Google Play use four content rating levels:

- Everyone
- Low maturity
- Medium maturity
- High maturity

These ratings are used to inform the users about the contents maturity level, and will block or filter content in regions where this is required.
To classify your apps rating level it is possible to take a survey in the Google developer console.
You can assign (or change) the content rating for your apps in the Developer Console.

- It is important to answer correct and truthfully on the survey as a misleading describtion or rating can result in removal of your app.

##5. Confirm the App's Overall Size

The max size for an APK published on Google Play is 100 MB. If your app exceeds that size, or if you want to offer a secondary download, you can use APK Expansion Files, which Google Play will host for free on its server infrastructure and automatically handle the download to devices.

You can use up to two (2) APK Expansion Files, each up to 2GB in size, for each APK.
Using APK Expansion files is a convenient, cost-effective method of distributing large apps. However, the use of APK Expansion Files requires some changes in your app binary, so you will need to make those changes before creating your release-ready APK.

Google Play hosts the expansion files for your application for free. 
The expansion files are saved to the device's shared storage location (the SD card or USB-mountable partition; also known as the "external" storage) where your app can access them. On most devices, Google Play downloads the expansion file(s) at the same time it downloads the APK, so your application has everything it needs when the user opens it for the first time. In some cases, however, your application must download the files from Google Play when your application starts.
